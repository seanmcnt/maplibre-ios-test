# maplibre-test
 Testing maplibre native iOS SwiftUI

Code for Setting up example SwiftUI project here
https://docs.maptiler.com/maplibre-gl-native-ios/ios-swiftui-basic-get-started/

Code was outdated as referenced older MGLMapView instead of MLNMapView

This is a working example with those changes made.

You will need to replace the API key in info.plist
